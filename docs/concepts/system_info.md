# System Info


The system info object is mostly for debugging, so you probably
don't need to worry about it.

Still here are the fields:

:arch: System architecture
:os: Operating system
:os_family: OS family (e.g. Windows, Unix)
:os_name: Name of the OS
:release: Python version
:build_date: build date of the python version
:memory_bits: Platform architecture bit size (32bit or 64bit)
:host: Name of the machine
